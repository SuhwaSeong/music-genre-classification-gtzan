# Music Genre Classifier

ðŸŽµ **Music Genre Classifier** â€” A multilingual audio classification web app built with Streamlit

---

## Overview

This project classifies music genres from `.wav` audio files using machine learning models (Random Forest and SVM) in Python.
It extracts MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) features from audio and inputs them into the models, providing classification results along with visualizations.

## Features

* Multilingual user interface supporting 20+ languages (including Korean, English, German)
* Choice between Random Forest and SVM classification models
* Upload multiple `.wav` files and select files for individual classification
* Displays predicted genre with probability bar charts
* Visualizes MFCC heatmaps for audio features
* Download classification reports and sample audio files

## Installation & Usage

1. Install Python 3.8 or higher
2. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set the path of model files (`rf_model.pkl`, `svm_model.pkl`, etc.) and report CSV files in the `BASE_PATH` variable inside `app.py`.
4. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
